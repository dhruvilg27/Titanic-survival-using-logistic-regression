# Titanic-survival-using-logistic-regression

# Abstract
The sinking of the Titanic ship resulted in the deaths of approximately thousand passengers
and the crew is one of the deaths in history .The
loss of life was mainly caused by the shortage of
lifeboats.the incident is that some people were
more durable to carry than many others ,such a
children ,women were the ones with the highest
priority to be rescued .The primary goal of the
algorithm is first to find predictable or
previously unknown data by implementing
exploratory data analysis on the available
training data and then applying different
machine learning models and classifiers to
complete the scan,this will help predict which
people are most likely to survive.
